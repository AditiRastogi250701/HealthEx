## Retinal Fundus

It is the interior lining of the eyeball, including the retina (the light-sensitive screen), optic disc (the head of the nerve to the eye), and the macula (the small spot in the retina where vision is keenest).

Without prompt diagnosis and treatment, retinal fundus diseases can cause irreversible vision loss. For the detection of diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and glaucoma, single disease-based deep learning algorithms had been developed.In this study, we used a DLM that can detect a variety of common referable fundus diseases and conditions (39 classes).


These findings suggest that our DLP can be used for retinal fundus disease triage, particularly in remote areas around the world.
