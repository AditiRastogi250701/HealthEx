## Retinal Fundus

It is the interior lining of the eyeball, including the retina (the light-sensitive screen), optic disc (the head of the nerve to the eye), and the macula (the small spot in the retina where vision is keenest).

Without prompt diagnosis and treatment, retinal fundus diseases can cause irreversible vision loss. For the detection of diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and glaucoma, single disease-based deep learning algorithms had been developed.In this study, we used a DLM that can detect a variety of common referable fundus diseases and conditions (39 classes).


The 39 classes are:


                                    1.Bietti crystalline dystrophy
                                    2.Blur fundus with suspected PDR
                                    3.Blur fundus without PDR

                                   26.Pathological myopia
                                   27.Peripheral retinal degeneration and break
                                   28.Possible glaucoma
                                   29.Preretinal hemorrhage
                                   30.RAO
                                   31.Retinitis pigmentosa
                                   32.Rhegmatogenous RD
                                   33.Severe hypertensive retinopathy
                                   34.Silicon oil in eye
                                   35.Tessellated fundus
                                   36.Vessel tortuosity

These findings suggest that our DLP can be used for retinal fundus disease triage, particularly in remote areas around the world.
